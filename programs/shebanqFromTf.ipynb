    "\n",
    "A run of this pipe produces shebanq data according to a chosen *version*.\n",

    "This data will be converted by notebook `tfFromMQL` in its `programs` directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "The pipe will try to load any text-fabric data features found in the `tf` subdirectories\n",

    "It will descend one level deeper, according to the chosen *version*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resulting data\n",
    "The resulting data will be delivered in the `shebanq` subdirectory of the core repo `bhsa`, \n",
    "and then under the chosen *version* subdirectory.\n",
