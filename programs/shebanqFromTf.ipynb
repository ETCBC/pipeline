    "\n",

    "of the ETCBC that is needed\n",
    "to compile the webstie data for\n",
    "[SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A run of the pipeline produces a shebanq data *version*.\n",
    "It should be run whenever there are new or updated data sources present that affect the output data.\n",
    "Since all input data is delivered in a Github repo, we have excellent machinery to \n",
    "work with versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe line works by pointing text-fabric to the data contained in the github repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is specified in the configuration below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core data\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data is what resides in \n",
    "the Github repo [bhsa](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) in directory `tf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will be converted by `tfFromMQL` in the `programs` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this action will be an updated TF resource in its \n",
    "`tf/core` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional data\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline will try to load any text-fabric features found in the `tf` subdirectories\n",
    "of the designated additional repos.\n",
    "It will descend one level deeper, according to the *version* that is to be gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resulting data\n",
    "The resulting data will be delivered in the `shebanq` subdirectory of the core repo `bhsa`, \n",
    "and then under a *version* subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One big mql file, containing the core data plus **all** additions: `bhsa-xx.mql`.\n",
    "  It will be bzipped. This smallish file (<30MB) is your *portable ETCBC*.\n",
    "  You can easily transfer it to your own machine (preferably by just `git pull origin master`),\n",
    "  and then you can run MQL queries on the full, actual, ETCBC data.\n",
    "* **not yet implemented** \n",
    "  A subdirectory `mysql` with database tables, containing everything SHEBANQ needs to construct its pages.\n",
    "* **not yet implemented**\n",
    "  A subdirectory `annotations`, containing bulk-uploadable annotation sets, that SHEBANQ can show in notes view,\n",
