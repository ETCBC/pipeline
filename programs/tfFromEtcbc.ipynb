    "# Text-Fabric from ETCBC\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assembles the data from the ETCBC that is needed\n",
    "to compile its datasets in text-fabric-format on Github.\n",
    "Ulltimately the data for the website [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org) will be\n",
    "derived from these TF-sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "This is **pipe 1** of the pipeline from ETCBC data to the website SHEBANQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "A run of this pipe produces a data *version*.\n",
    "It should be run whenever there are new or updated data sources present that affect the output data.\n",
    "Since all input data is delivered in a Github repo, we have excellent machinery to \n",
    "work with versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe works by executing a series of programs, contained in Github repositories.\n",
    "For each repository in the pipe, a series of notebooks will be executed.\n",
    "See [script mode](https://github.com/ETCBC/pipeline/blob/master/README.md#operation) for \n",
    "details on how we call notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is specified in the configuration below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core data\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data is delivered by the ETCBC as `bhsa.mql.bz2` in \n",
    "the Github repo [bhsa](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) in directory `source`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will be converted by `tfFromMQL` in the `programs` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this action will be an updated TF resource in its \n",
    "`tf/core` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional data\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have contributed to the dataset, \n",
    "but not all that data is in the core.\n",
    "They are typically in the repository where the research has been \n",
    "executed, and where the data is documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the pipe starts, these repos must be pulled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous version\n",
    "Version `c` acts as a *continuous* version. It will be overwritten\n",
    "by new snapshots of the data on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We support the following workflow to carry out these updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make a new version called `_temp`. Note:\n",
    "   * this choice of name prevents it to reach github, because `_temp` directories are in `.gitignore`;\n",
    "   * after running this workflow, the version `_temp` already exists, this is not a problem;\n",
    "2. put a new data snapshot in the `source/_temp` directory of the `bhsa` repo, add also data to the\n",
    "   `source/_temp` directories of the other repos in the pipeline, as far as relevant;\n",
    "3. run `good = runPipeline(pipeline, versions=['_temp'], force=True)`. Note:\n",
    "   * we use `force=True` here, because then the old data in version `_temp` will be thoroughly overwritten;\n",
    "4. if all went well run `copyVersion(pipeline, '_temp', 'c')`. This will overwrite all data directories\n",
    "   in version `c` by the just created data directories in `temp`."
